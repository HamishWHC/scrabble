# Rust Scrabble

This is a project I am using to learn the basics of Rust! Currently the project consists of a scrabble 'engine' made up of various structs and associated functions (a.k.a. methods but the compiler never calls them that...). It also has some basic turn taking code (automated, so the user cannot actually play yet).

I'm thinking of making a GUI using some Rust GUI libraries, since CLI Scrabble would be a pain to play (and program!). We shall see!
